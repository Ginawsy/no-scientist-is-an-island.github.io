## Why is this important?

1. Being more transparent with how you generate data derivatives will save both you and your current and future labmates time, energy, and money.
2. Using a derived data registry will facilitate collaboration: you will be able to share variables and derivative-generating scripts almost instantaneously.
3. Following this proposed workflow (or a specific adaptation for your group) will make you a better scientist: your coding skills will improve, your analytic processes will be streamlined, and your results will be more reproducible.
4. Using a derived data registry will prevent knowledge loss when lab members graduate and/or leave for other jobs.
