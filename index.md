# No scientist is an island: Working smarter to share data derivatives
In collaborative scientific research with human subjects, it is extremely common for datasets to be used by multiple researchers. Researchers often meaningfully transform variables before including them in their models or analyses. These transformed variables are called data derivatives, and they may be useful to others in the same lab, to collaborators, and to the scientific community more broadly. 

Our work aims to support researchers in creating replicable and accurate data derivatives in a highly accessible way. When data derivatives are not replicable, accurate, and accessible, researchers may be more likely to duplicate efforts and coding errors are more likely to exist/persist. Here, we propose a set of principles, workflows, and a template to help research teams manage the proliferation of data derivatives. 

This set of tools was developed by researchers in psychology and neuroscience for use with human subjects data, but may be adapted for use in other contexts. 


## How can this help _you_? 
1. Being more transparent with how you generate data derivatives will save both you and your current and future labmates time, energy, and money.
2. Using a derived data registry will facilitate collaboration: you will be able to share variables and derivative-generating scripts almost instantaneously.
3. Following this proposed workflow (or a specific adaptation for your group) will train better scientists: coding skills will improve, analytic processes will be streamlined, and results will be more reproducible.
4. Using a derived data registry will prevent knowledge loss when lab members graduate and/or leave for other jobs.
