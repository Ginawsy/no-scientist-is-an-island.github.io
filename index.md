# No scientist is an island: Working smarter to share data derivatives
In collaborative scientific research with human subjects, it is extremely common for datasets to be used by multiple researchers. Researchers often meaningfully transform variables before including them in their models or analyses. These transformed variables are called data derivatives, and they may be useful to others in the same lab, to collaborators, and to the scientific community more broadly. 

Our work aims to support researchers in creating replicable and accurate data derivatives in a highly accessible way. When data derivatives are not replicable, accurate, and accessible, researchers may be more likely to duplicate efforts and coding errors are more likely to exist/persist. Here, we propose a set of principles, workflows, and a template to help research teams manage the proliferation of data derivatives. 

This set of tools was developed by researchers in psychology and neuroscience for use with human subjects data, but may be adapted for use in other contexts. 


## How can this help _you_? 
1. **Transparently and systematically tracking data derivatives promotes efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility in science.** Being more transparent with how you generate data derivatives--and systematically logging that progress--will save both you time and energy in the long run. Your future self will be grateful! Additionally, following this proposed workflow (or a specific adaptation for your group) will make you a better scientist: your coding skills will improve, your analytic processes will be streamlined, and your results will be more reproducible.  
2. **Contributing to a lab’s derived data registry will unite your lab and promote good lab citizenship.** You put in the work to create a derivative–now that effort can be paid forward! Using a derived data registry will prevent knowledge loss when lab members graduate and/or leave for other jobs. By contributing your work to a derived data registry through the process of developing, testing, and reviewing the code, you will also help contribute to a lab culture valuing kindness, learning and growth. A psychologically safe lab environment will accelerate learning and knowledge-sharing.  
3. **Creating and maintaining a derived data registry fosters collaboration.** Ever received an email from a collaborator asking about a variable you derived a few years ago? Maybe you’re able to find it somewhere deep in your analysis code, or maybe not… If you had contributed the variable and the script to a derived data registry, then you would be able to quickly find and send what your collaborator is asking for! This will help you standardize data derivatives across large collaborations and consortia.
