# Setting up a derived data registry

## Assumptions
This setup assumes that researchers are working from a shared primary dataset, have some way to store those data, and work on analyses in project folders. 

Derived data registries should be flexible enough to work regardless of your project folder structures. However, we have two recommendations: 
1. Place project folders in spaces that are shared with team members when possible (e.g., Dropbox, Sharepoint, Box, or your institution's preferred platform). That way, people can understand the context that variables were created in, and can collectively monitor to see if the derived data registry becomes outdated.  
2. Considering adopting a data specification format that is internally consistent across the lab. One option is [Psych-DS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8o5jnWk0Iqp_J06PTu5NjBfVsdoPbBhstht6W0fFp0/edit), an emerging standard modeled after the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](bids.neuroimaging.io/). Following this data specificaiton standard may foster a more robust science by making it easier for researchers to easily understand one another's project files, including code and analysis.  

## Parts of a derived data registry 
A derived data registry has three components: a log, code, and data.

### Derived data log


## Derived data code
