# Setting up a derived data registry

## Assumptions
This setup assumes that researchers are working from a shared primary dataset, have some way to store those data, and work on analyses in project folders. Since this project is mainly about data deriviatves, we won't say too much more about this, except for the following: 
1. We recommend putting project folders in spaces that are shared with team members when possible (e.g., Dropbox, Sharepoint, Box, or your institution's preferred platform) That way, people can understand the context that variables were created in, and can collectively monitor to see if the derived data registry becomes outdated.  
2. Psych-DS is a data specification standard that people in the field have been working on collaboratively. It is modeled after the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). Following this standard may foster a more robust science by making it easier for researchers to easily understand, share, and check data and analyses.  

## Parts of a derived data registry 
A derived data registry has three components: a log, code, and data.

### Derived data log


## Derived data code


## Derived data itself
