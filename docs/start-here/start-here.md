## What is a derived variable? 
When exploring data and running analyses, researchers manipulate raw data to create many kinds of new variables. Derived variables are variables that are computed from the raw data.

## What derived variables should I keep track of? 
We think a good general rule is that a derived variable (or set of derived varaibles) is likely worth tracking and logging if it is being included into models for analysis.

## What is a derived data registry? 
We propose the use of a derived data registry to track and share derived data. A derived data registry has three components: 
1. Derived data log
2. Code for generating derived variables
3. Derived variables

## Who should use a derived data registry?
Derived data registries were designed for a group of researchers working together from the same primary data source. However, this structure can also be adopted by people working on a dataset alone for organization and future code sharing.

The flexible structure of a derived data registry means that it can be created for a dataset, project team, lab, or even for collaboration teams across sites. Creating derived data registries at larger scales can help disseminate code for derived variables across datasets, but requires greater coordination to maintain.
