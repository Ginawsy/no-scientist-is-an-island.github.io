# Example
This example highlights how a derived data repository can facilitate easier access to specific variables from a shared dataset.

This is an example of (**a project repository**)[https://github.com/no-scientist-is-an-island/example-dataset/] formatted in Psych-DS and shared by the developers of that specification. 

( maybe add a screenshot? )

Two variables derived from this dataset were logged and had their data and code transfererd to the (**derived data registry**)[https://github.com/no-scientist-is-an-island/example-derived-data-registry]. This derived data registry makes it easier for other researchers and users to find and work with the specific variables they need.
