# FAQ

## What is a derived variable? 
When exploring data and running analyses, researchers manipulate raw data to create many kinds of new variables. Derived variables are variables that are computed from the raw data.

## What derived variables should I keep track of? 
We think a good general rule is that a derived variable (or set of derived varaibles) is likely worth tracking and logging if it is being included into models for analysis.

## What is a derived data registry? 
We propose the use of a derived data registry to track and share derived data. A derived data registry which is a directory containing three components: 
1. Derived data log
2. Code for generating derived variables
3. Derived variables

## What's the right scale for a derived data registry? In other words, should there be one for each lab? each dataset? each analysis? 


## How do you ensure that the code in the repository is usable? 
We encourage code authors to follow best practices for writing code (LINK?) and for groups to participate in code review (LINK). As an added benefit, this helps everyone improve their coding skills over time.
