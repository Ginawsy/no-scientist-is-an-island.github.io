# How to log your progress

An important interaction with the derived data registry is to regularly update your derivative's status. This status (`logStatus` field in the registry) communicates to your group where you are in the workflow:

* <font color="#F88379">under development</font>
* <font color="#fcea50">under review</font>
* <font color="#24db2f">registered</font>
* <font color="#74797b">abandoned</font>
