# How to log your progress

An important interaction with the derived data registry is to regularly update your derivative's status. This status (`logStatus` field in the registry) communicates to your group where you are in the workflow:

* <span style="background-color: #F88379">under development</span>: 
* <span style="background-color: #fcea50">under review</span>
* <span style="background-color: #24db2f">registered</span>
* <span style="background-color: #a1a4a5">abandoned</span>
