# How to implement this workflow

Making a change to your existing workflow can be challenging. We suggest building these steps in to existing, natural checkpoints in your workflow, such as circulating a conference abstract draft or a manuscript draft. 

### Example  
If you create and use a derivative for an analysis and then write an abtract for those results, when you send the abstract out to your PI and co-authors for review, include a description of the status of this derivative in the directory and state what you need in order to progress to the next step. If your derivative hasn't progressed to code review yet, then this is a great time to schedule one! If you're already through code review, then submit it to the registry at this time.
